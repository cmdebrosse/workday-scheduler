# workday-scheduler

Deployed app: https://cmdebrosse.github.io/workday-scheduler/

Github repo: https://github.com/cmdebrosse/workday-scheduler

This app creates a standard day in the life scheduler. It provides time blocks for every hour from the time a person's day may start to the time where they go to bed. The user can fill out the text areas in each hour block and save their changes inside their private browser. The time blocks are color coded to give a visual representation of past (gray), present (red), and future (green).

The code is made up of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also uses JQuery and Bootstrap frameworks. Please enjoy the video below demonstrating the app in action.
